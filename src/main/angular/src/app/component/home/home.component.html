<section class="home">
    <div class="name-header">
        <span *ngIf="username">logged in as: {{username}}</span>
    </div>
    <button id="logout" mat-stroked-button color="accent" routerLink="/login">logout</button>
    <p>Just want to point out that this resolves the issue for running locally on the machine. I'm not sure if it solves it for Cloud9 per the OP original question above. –

        This is the right an clean solution if you want to enable it on every ng serve (and probably you want to in development) –

        Is there a way to configure this for the development environment only? –

        @JellicleCat Set "disableHostCheck": false under architect -> serve -> configurations -> production –

        You need to specify the host
        
        ng serve --port 8080 --host 123.34.56.78

        The above solution might work too but this is what I needed. –

        This works for me :
        
        ngrok http --host-header=rewrite PORT
        for instance :</p>
